# Hi, I'm Miguel Mondaca  
I'm a graphic designer with 11 years of experience in web development and design. Throughout my career, I've developed projects for a wide range of clients across sectors like education, hospitality, media and more. My passion for digital design began early when I built my first website at 11, and I've been evolving my skills ever since to stay ahead of industry trends.
